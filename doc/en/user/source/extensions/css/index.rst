CSS Styling
===========

The CSS extension adds an alternative style editor to GeoServer that uses a CSS-derived language instead of SLD. These CSS styles are internally converted to SLD, which is then used as normal by GeoServer. The CSS syntax is duplicated from SVG styling where appropriate, but extended to avoid losing facilities provided by SLD when possible.
