.. _installation_osx_installer:Mac OS X installer==================The Windows installer provides an easy way to set up GeoServer on your system, as it requires no configuration files to be edited or command line settings.#. Make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system. GeoServer requires a **Java 7** environment, and the JRE supplied by OS X is not sufficient. For more information, please see the `instructions for installing Oracle Java on OS X <http://java.com/en/download/faq/java_mac.xml>`_.   .. note:: Java 8 is not currently supported.   .. note:: For more information about Java and GeoServer, please see the section on :ref:`production_java`.#. Navigate to the `GeoServer Download page <http://geoserver.org/download>`_.#. Select the version of GeoServer that you wish to download.
