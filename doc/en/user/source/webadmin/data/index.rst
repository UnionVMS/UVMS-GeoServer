Data
====

This section is the largest and perhaps the most important section of the Web Administration Interface. 
It describes the core configuration data types that GeoServer uses to access and publish geospatial information.
Each subsection describes the data type pages which provide add, view, edit, and delete capabilities.

The main page for each data type is a list view showing the items of that data type configured in the GeoServer instance.
For information on how to use these pages see :ref:`webadmin_lists`.
