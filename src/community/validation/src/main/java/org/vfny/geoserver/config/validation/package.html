Validation Model being edited.

<p>
This class opperates as the Validation Model and is stored in Web Container.
</p>
Details:
<ul>
<li>
Represents the Model of the STRUTS based Model-View-Controller Design
</li>
<li>
Will support additional user-interface state, beyond requirements of the
GeoServer Validation application.
</li>
<li>
Makes use of GeoTools2 and Vivid.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of the course of sorting this stuff out we have had a couple of bad ideas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is tempting to replace a lot of these classes by changing the scope of the
FormBeans to session, rather than request. I cannot convince my self that this
would be a good idea, as storing the configuration model (and associated
resources in the Web Container) is sure to prevent duplication in the face
of multiple users configuring differnt subsystems. If the state was limited
to session - they would manage to overwrite each other with no prior warning.
</li>
<li>
It is tempting to make the Actions use the DTO objects directly (or forgo the
config classes entierly). Having the config classes allows us to make
whatever methods we need for easy, quick ui developement without breaking
the rest of the application.
</li>
</ul>
